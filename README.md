# Energy Prediction by the Hour

This project aims to predict energy consumption by the hour using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast energy usage, which can be valuable for various applications such as energy management, demand planning, and cost optimization.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing historical energy consumption data by the hour. The dataset includes features such as date, time, weather conditions, and other relevant variables that may impact energy usage. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

1. Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distribution of variables, and identify any patterns or trends.

2. Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. This may involve techniques such as lagging variables, creating interaction terms, or encoding categorical variables.

3. Model Development: Train and evaluate various machine learning models to predict energy consumption. This may include regression models such as linear regression, decision tree-based models like random forest or gradient boosting, or more advanced techniques like neural networks.

4. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE). Compare the performance of different models to select the best-performing one.

5. Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is selected, deploy it in a production environment to make real-time predictions. This may involve creating an API or integrating the model into an existing system.
